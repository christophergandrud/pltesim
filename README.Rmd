Version: `r packageVersion('pltesim')` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/christophergandrud/pltesim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/christophergandrud/pltesim)

# About

**pltesim** implements [Williams's (2016)](http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/243) method for simulating probabilistic long-term effects in models with temporal dependence. 

It is built on the [coreSim](https://github.com/christophergandrud/coreSim) 
package.

# Process

To find and show probabilistic long-term effects in models with temporal dependence with **pltesim**:

1. Estimate the coefficients. Currently **pltesim** works with
binary outcome models, e.g. logit, so use `glm` from the default R installation.

2. Create a data frame with your counterfactual. This should have a row with the fitted counterfactual values and columns with names matching those in your fitted model. All variables without values will be treated as 0 in the counterfactual.

3. Simulate the long-term effects with `plte_builder`. 

4. Plot the results with `plte_plot`.

# Examples 

These examples replicate Figure 1 in [Williams (2016)](http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/243). First estimate your model. You may need to use `btscs` to generate spells for the binary dependent variable. 

```{r}
library(pltesim)
library(ggplot2)

data('negative')

# BTSCS set the data
neg_set <- btscs(df = negative, event = 'y', t_var = 'tim',
                 cs_unit = 'group', pad_ts = FALSE)


# Create temporal dependence variables
neg_set$t <- neg_set$spell + 1

m1 <- glm(y ~ x + t + I(t^2) + I(t^3),
          family = binomial(link = 'logit'),
          data = neg_set)
```

Then fit the counterfactual:

```{r}
counterfactual <- data.frame(x = 0.5)
```

Now simulate and plot long-term effects for a variety of scenarios using `plte_builder` and `plte_plot`. `plte_builder` takes as its input the fitted model object with the estimated coefficients (`obj`), an identification of the basic time period variable (`obj_tvar`), the counterfactual (`cf`), how long the counterfactual persists (`cf_duration`, it is `permanent` by default), and the time period points over which to simulate the effects. 

Note that by default the predicted probabilities from logistic regression models are found. You can specify a custom quantity of interest function with the `FUN` argument. 

In this first example the counterfactual is persistent throughout the entire time span:

```{r perm}
# Permanent
sim1 <- plte_builder(obj = m1, obj_tvar = 't',
                     cf = counterfactual, t_points = c(13, 25))

plte_plot(sim1) + ggtitle('Permanent')
```

Note that the numbers next to each simulation point indicate the time since
the last event. You can choose to not show these numbers by setting `t_labels = FALSE` in the `plte_plot` call.

In the next example, the effect only lasts for one time period:

```{r onetime}
# One-time
sim2 <- plte_builder(obj = m1, obj_tvar = 't', cf_duration = 'one-time',
                     cf = counterfactual, t_points = c(13, 25))

plte_plot(sim2) + ggtitle('One-time')
```

We can also have the counterfactual effect last for short periods of time and simulate the effect if another event occurs:

```{r temp-multievent}
# Temporary
sim3 <- plte_builder(obj = m1, obj_tvar = 't', cf_duration = 4,
                     cf = counterfactual, t_points = c(13, 25))

plte_plot(sim3) + ggtitle('Temporary')


# Multiple events, permanent counter factual
sim4 <- plte_builder(obj = m1, obj_tvar = 't',
                     cf = counterfactual, t_points = c(13, 20, 25))

plte_plot(sim4) + ggtitle('Permanent, Multiple Events')
```

By default the baseline scenario has all covariate values fitted at 0. You can supply a custom baseline scenario in the second row of the counterfactual (`cf`) data frame. For example:

```{r custom-baseline}
# Custom baseline scenario
counterfactual_baseline <- data.frame(x = c(1, 0.5))

sim5 <- plte_builder(obj = m1, obj_tvar = 't', cf_duration = 4,
                     cf = counterfactual_baseline, t_points = c(13, 25))

plte_plot(sim5) + ggtitle('Temporary, Custom Baseline')
```
