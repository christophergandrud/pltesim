# Version 0.1.2

- Linetype for `plte_plot` now matches Williams (2016), e.g. solid lines for
Y = 1.

# Version 0.1.1

- `plte_builder` finds polynomial splines using the B-spline basis. Note: apart
from the degree of the piecewise polynomial, the default behaviour for `bs`
is assumed.

- Added ability to supply a custom baseline scenario to `plte_builder via
the `cf` argument.

# Version 0.1.0

- Minimal working version.
